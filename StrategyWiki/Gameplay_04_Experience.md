## Experience

Experience points are earned when the player accomplishes certain tasks. There are three areas in which players gain experience, and eventually level up:

- Battle Sense
- Light Weapons
- A third, class-specific area
Levels are increased when you hit the following thresholds in each category:

- Level 1: 20 XP
- Level 2: 50 XP
- Level 3: 90 XP
- Level 4: 140 XP
Each is covered in greater detail below.

## Battle Sense

Battle Sense is a bravery skill that rewards all classes for surviving combat. 2XP is gained per 30 seconds while inflicting damage. 5XP is gained for every 30 seconds while inflicting and receiving damage. 8XP per 30 seconds is gained while killing an enemy and receiving damage.

Rewards for levelling up in battle sense are:

### Issued Binoculars

Press B to activate your binoculars. Field ops can use binoculars to call artillery strikes and covert ops can use binocs to spot landmines.

### Increased Physical Fitness

The powerful aerobic benefits of prolonged combat activity enable your Stamina bar to recharge at 160% of the normal rate.

### Improved Health

Increases your maximum HP by 30 points.

### Trap Awareness

Even if you're not a Covert Ops, you'll be able to sense enemy Land Mines without the aid of Binoculars. Any mines within a certain range will appear as translucent outlines in your field of vision. Unless you're a Covert Ops, you won't be able to spot them for your team-mates.

## Light Weapons

Light Weapons applies to kills with small arms (submachine guns and pistols) and unscoped rifles. Players earn 3 XP per kill with a grenade or a shot to the body. 5 points of experience are gained per kill with a shot to an enemy's head. As players gain experience, certain rewards are gained:

### Improved Use of Light Weapons Ammunition

### Improved Light Weapon Handling

### Dual-wield Pistols

Soldiers with this ability can use two pistols at once. Those will appear after respawning, you don't have them immeadiately after receiving this level.

## Heavy Weapons

Heavy Weapons applies primarily to soldiers. Although a player, regardless of class, gains 3 points of experience when killing an enemy using a stationary or vehicle-mounted machine gun, only soldiers can make use of the bonuses. Heavy weapons experience is also gained by killing an enemy with any heavy weapon: flamethrowers, portable machine guns, mortars, and panzerfausts all give 3 XP per kill.

Heavy weapon bonuses are as follows:

### Improved Projectile Resources

Firing a Panzerfaust or Mortar will now take 1/3rd less Power Bar than previously.

### Medic Ammo

Medics receive an extra ammunition clip and grenade with their basic weapon load-out.

### Improved Medic Resources

2 syringes extra max ammo, 2 extra on spawn plus Medic pack only takes 15% Power Bar instead of 25%

### Full Revive

These new green syringes resurrect a teammate at full, rather than half, health.

### Adrenaline Self

Pressing the Special Weapons 1 Key (5 by default) will allow a player to inject him or herself with adrenaline. Damage is halved for ten seconds, and the stamina meter will not decrease at all, even when sprinting.

## Engineering

Engineers earn 3 XP for repairing a vehicle or MG. 5XP is gained for a 50% of Power Bar objective such as repairing an MG nest, 7.5 for a 100% Power Bar objective like repairing a tank and up to 10XP for destroying an Objective. Engineers also earn 3XP for a Rifle Grenade kill, 4XP for a Land Mine or Dynamite kill, 4XP for defusing an enemy Land Mine and 6 points for defusing enemy Dynamite.

### Improved Construction and Destruction

### Flak Jacket

## Signals

One point of experience is gained for every ammo pack distributed to an ally. 3XP is gained for every enemy player you kill with an Air Strike, 4XP for killing them with an Artillery Strike and 5XP for destroying an Objective with either.

Signals bonuses include:

### Improved Signals

### Improved Air and Ground Support

Artillery strikes last twice as long, and airstrikes have two planes instead of one.

### Enemy Recognition

Disguised enemy Covert Ops can be identified. Targeting one will result in "Disguised Enemy!" appearing, and their position will be revealed on the command map.

## Covert Ops

Covert Ops experience is gauged on your ability to eliminate enemies using scoped weapons, disguising yourself, and destroying objectives or enemies using satchel charges. ANY player earns 5XP for kills with a headshot, 3XP for kills with a bodyshot, armshot or legshot. A Covert Ops will earn 3XP for each Land Mine spotted and 5XP for disguising themselves using an enemy uniform. 5XP is gained for every kill with a Satchel Charge and 7XP every time an objective is destroyed using one.
