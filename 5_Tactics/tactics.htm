<H3><FONT color=#ffffff>Basic Team Techniques</FONT></H3>
<H4><FONT color=#ffffff>Overview</FONT></H4><font color="#C0C0C0">For many people, RTCW is the first 
team-based FPS they've played. If you're like me, I've played a lot of FPS 
games, but mostly deathmatch or team deathmatch, nothing like the interdependent 
class-based system in RTCW. Teamwork is the key to success and many effective 
team techniques can be practiced with other people you haven't 'trained' with. 
It's a matter of everyone understanding some fundamentals and understanding what 
others are trying to do. What I'd like to do now is discuss some basic fire team 
(e.g., small teams of 2-4) concepts - not the entire Allied or Axis team, but 
techniques you can use with just one or two others.</font> 
<P>  
<H4><FONT color=#ffffff>Team Integrity</FONT></H4>
<UL>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Never go anywhere by yourself. Individual players running around a map are 
too easy to pick off and it's hard to keep track of everything yourself.</font> 
</LI></UL>
<P> </P>
<UL>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">A coordinated team of two is more than twice as effective as a single person 
running around.</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">If you're not leading a team, then follow someone else and stick to them. 
Watch where everyone runs off to upon respawn and if you see a player running 
off on their own, follow them (assuming they haven't proven themselves to be 
total jerks).</font> </LI></UL>
<H4><FONT color=#ffffff>Movement</FONT></H4>
<UL>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">When traveling down corridors, don't stack up behind each other. People 
should be in a staggered file on opposite walls. If enemy contact is made, this 
lets the first 2-3 people shoot back and provides some spacing in case an enemy 
tosses a grenade. If you're in a single file, not only can you not shoot back, 
but also any enemy bullets that miss the lead man will probably hit someone in 
the middle of the file. Why make it easier for them?</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">When traveling in more open areas, the staggered file still works but you 
probably want to have a little more space. A wedge with just a little more space 
keeps fields of fire open and the dispersion helps protect against artillery 
fire and air strikes. Also, having a few people trailing behind may give you a 
bit of a jump on any enemy who shoots at the pointman. They might not have seen 
the rest of the team before opening fire.</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Constantly look around, up, left and right, AND behind you. The team needs 
to stay aware of what's going on around them. You probably want to stop every 
now and then and just listen for what's going on.</font> 
<P><IMG height=292 hspace=10 src="RTCW02.jpg" width=408 align=right> <I>This 
should be familiar as the tunnel to No Man's Land on the Wizernes map. If people 
take up firing positions in the red zone, teammates are forced to cross in front 
of and will block their line of fire. Conversely, if people take up positions in 
the green zone, enough space is left behind them for teammates to move into No 
Man's Land without blocking LOF</I> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">When at all possible, do not cross in front of another person's line of 
fire. Try to pass behind them. Don't count on the other player recognizing that 
you're there and not shooting when you run in front of them. The corollary to 
this rule is that if you take up a firing position, make sure you leave space 
for people to pass behind you. If you can't, then it is your responsibility to 
watch out for friendlies that might block your line of fire.</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Don't crowd the doors. Nothing sucks more than running from fire only to 
find your exit blocked by someone standing in it. In fact, on beach, you'll 
often see me standing in the door at the top of the stairs by the breach, on the 
inside of the room, overwatching the door from the axis spawn. That way I don't 
block the door, can shoot over the heads of people coming in, yet still suppress 
enemy reinforcements coming through the door. Also, it's harder for the enemy to 
see you when you're at the back of a room, vs. silhouetted in the doorway.</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">If you're the last man in the column or wedge, look behind you every now and 
then. It's worth it to check your six periodically to make sure the bad people 
aren't sneaking up on you.</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">The pointman also needs to turn around occassionally to see if anyone is 
still moving in the same direction as he is or even just to make sure the rest 
of the team is still there.</font> </LI></UL>
<H4><FONT color=#ffffff>Actions on contact</FONT></H4>
<UL>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">When contact is made, not everyone should shoot back, just those with clean 
lines of fire (LOF). Anyone not engaging the enemy should 1) look for other 
enemies coming up the flank, 2) move into supporting positions where they can 
return fire, drop med packs, or provide ammo, or 3) look for opportunities to 
flank the enemy up front.</font> 
<P><font color="#C0C0C0"><IMG height=314 hspace=10 src="RTCW18.jpg" width=505 align=right></font></P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Upon contact, the first 2 or 3 people with clear lines of fire should engage 
and try to move on-line with one another - meaning moving up so that your team 
forms a line - maximizing the amount of fire that can be delivered. Circle 
strafe left or right so that your wedge expands into a pocket that envelopes the 
enemy element. This accomplishes 2 goals 1), opens up LOF for people behind you 
and 2) sets up a cross fire on the target. Typically, people try to dodge left 
or right. If you are shooting at a target along two axis of movement, then the 
target is always dodging towards/away from one of the shooters, making it easier 
for one of you to hit.</font> 
<P><I><font color="#C0C0C0">In this example, we have a three man team moving in a staggered file, each 
with an assigned zone to watch. Once contact is made, the point man immediately 
returns fire. The trailing two men, move on line and establish interlocking 
fires on the two enemy soldiers</font></I> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">The key is to gang up on the opposition wherever possible. If my team of 2 
runs into another team of 2, I'll often make sure I'm shooting at the same guy 
as my partner, even if I'm taking fire from the other guy. The faster we put one 
down, the faster we can turn both guns on #2</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">If you can find a way to flank the enemy, do so. This could mean moving 
on-line as I just mentioned, or backing off a bit and finding another route to a 
position from which you can start firing at the enemies sides. Make sure that 
the rest of your element knows what you're doing because they may have to cover 
you and you don't want them to start pulling back while you're off sneaking 
around.</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">If you have to retreat from a position, grenades are good tools to buy some 
time. If possible, the second person closest to the enemy should toss the 
grenade so that the closest person can keep up a stream of fire. Once the 
grenade is tossed, the #2 man runs back to take up a position where he can cover 
the withdrawal of the #1 man.</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Once the firefight is over, establish security and begin stocking up on 
health and ammo. One person should always be watching while the others stock up 
on ammo, health, and reload. Lieutenants and medics should go to the person on 
security to deliver ammo and health to him. As people get topped off, they 
should take up security positions. This improves the overall security of the 
team and signals to the LTs and medics that you don't need any more assistance.</font> 
</LI></UL>
<H4><FONT color=#ffffff>Setting up interlocking fields of fire</FONT></H4><IMG 
height=215 hspace=10 src="RTCW03.jpg" width=461 align=right> <I><font color="#C0C0C0">In this 
illustration, I've set up a blocking team of 2 shooters and a medic. Their job 
is to prevent Allied entry into No Man's Land. Both gunners are shooting 
diagonally into the tunnel and have nice interlocking fires at the mouth of the 
tunnel. Neither is shooting directly at the other. A medic stands by in cover to 
pick up any Allied soldiers who might get through and to patch up any damage 
either of the two shooters might take.</font></I> 
<UL>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Setting up effective crossfires with a little bit of depth and support are 
extremely effective. On a map like Assault, the Allied team can effectively 
bottle the Axis team inside the rear Axis spawn point because they can 
concentrate a large amount of firepower on a small exit door while Axis return 
fire is minimized by the same constricting door. The Allied team can direct all 
of their fire on Axis soldiers emerging one at a time from the spawn point.</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Ideally, no friendly player sets up directly in front of the engagement 
area. If the enemy is moving properly, this allows them to concentrate their 
return fire on you, before the rest of your team engages them fully. You 
actually want to direct fire into their flanks.</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Firing from the flanks accomplishes 2 things, 1) the enemy has to turn from 
their direction of movement to deal with you and 2) by turning, their fire is 
split while your fire is still concentrated on them which improves your 
survivability.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Be careful not to set up in such a way that a friendly person is in your 
cone of fire.</font> 
<P> </P>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">If you have a third person on the team, let them pick up leakers, or enemy 
who make it through your interlocking fire. You'll have to trust that the 
forward element has wounded them enough so that the floating man can take care 
of the leakers. A medic is a good choice for a floater since he can also move 
forward and supply med packs to the wounded.</font> </LI></UL>
<H4><FONT color=#ffffff>Working with other classes (Very Basic)</FONT></H4><font color="#C0C0C0">I'm 
only going to offer very basic tips about working with other classes. There is 
too much to write about to discuss any particular class in detail. I do 
recommend that you take a few turns playing each of the other classes so that 
you gain a better understanding of where they might need support.</font> 
<UL>
<LI><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Engineers</B>.</FONT>  <font color="#C0C0C0"> Often times the engineer's 
mission is to blow a game critical objective. Protecting the engineer often 
makes the difference between winning the game and losing the game. Protect the 
engineer by:</font> 
<UL>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Giving him room to work. Don't stand between him and the objective he's 
trying to blow so that you can watch.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Do take up a covering position where you can pick up and engage any enemies 
coming in to stop the engineer.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Once the dynamite has been successfully planted, DO NOT run away, the 
dynamite still has to be protected.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">If the enemy comes out to disarm the dynamite, prioritize your fire against 
the enemy engineers. If you kill them all, your engineers' mission was a 
success, regardless of how many other enemy soldiers are still standing around.</font> 
</LI></UL>
<P> </P>
<LI><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Medics</B>. </FONT><font color="#C0C0C0">Medics are the life blood of a 
team. They provide critical sustainability so that a team isn't constantly 
losing people to the respawn point and your team doesn't lose valuable time 
moving from the spawn point to the front lines. Make their job of healing you 
easier by:</font> 
<UL>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Covering the medic while they go to revive fallen comrades. Often, the 
fallen are out in the open and the medic will need some covering fire while they 
sprint out to the fallen and get them back on their feet.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Giving them room to work and not getting in their way</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">As the fallen comrade, don't limbo out immediately. Look around to see if 
there is a medic around who can get to you. When the respawn timer is about to 
run out, tap out and then respawn. Please do not tap out when you see a medic 
running towards you. There's nothing more frustrating than braving enemy fire to 
reach a fallen buddy only to see them fade into the ground.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Also, be aware that once your revived, you won't be able to move for a 
couple of seconds. However, you can still shoot - this may give you an 
opportunity to provide some cover for the medic if he gets attacked while 
reviving you.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Once you're revived, get the hell back into cover so that I won't have to 
make a second trip out for you.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">When being resupplied with health, there is no good reason why you need to 
face the medic. Take up a security position and let the medic hand med packs 
into your back.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Medics can hand out 4 med packs at full charge, no more. If a medic doesn't 
hand out a med pack when you ask, it may be that his charge meter is low. Don't 
constantly bug him.</font> </LI></UL>
<P> </P>
<LI><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Lieutenants</B>. </FONT><font color="#C0C0C0">Lieutenants are also critical 
to sustaining a team. They can also provide needed heavy firepower to harass, 
delay, and support. Help them out by:</font> 
<UL>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Following the lieutenants and supporting them so that they stay alive long 
enough to provide you with ammunition.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">When being resupplied with ammo, there is no good reason why you need to 
face the lieutenant. Take up a security position and let the LT hand ammo packs 
into your back. When you're topped off, move off so that the LT knows that you 
don't need any more.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Lieutenants can hand out 4 ammo packs at full charge, no more. If one 
doesn't hand out an ammo pack when you ask, it may be that his charge meter is 
low or he's conserving charge for air strikes (requires at least half a charge) 
and artillery (requires full charge). Don't constantly bug him.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Keep this in mind too, when the LT is running backwards and tossing out ammo 
packs, those 4 packs have to be shared with the rest of the team. Be careful not 
to take more than your fair share of ammo.</font> </LI></UL>
<P> </P>
<LI><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Soldiers</B>.</FONT>  <font color="#C0C0C0"> Soldiers with heavy weapons fill 
very specific mission roles. Each heavy weapon is very useful for certain tasks, 
but also has its downsides. You have to appreciate how these weapons work and 
plan that into your interaction with the heavy weapons soldier. Help them out 
by:</font> 
<UL>
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Supporting soldiers with heavy weapons. They have specific missions in each 
game but are vulnerable if left to run around on their own. It's useful to have 
another player around to provide some cover fire as they get their heavy weapons 
ready (panzerfaust or venom cannon) or while they run around with the puny 
little pistols.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Providing security. They're probably pretty focused on a specific target and 
might miss the close by enemy approaching. It's your job to pick them up. Often 
times the heavy weapon will soften up a group of enemy enough where you can 
finish them off pretty easily.</font> 
<LI><font color="#C0C0C0">Staying out of their way. Flamers and panzerfausts are area effect weapons. 
Give them room to work.</font> </LI></UL></LI></UL>
