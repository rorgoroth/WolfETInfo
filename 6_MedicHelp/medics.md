### Medics

#
## Why be a medic?

Medics are the nurturing mother figure of a ET/RTCW team. They are vital to ensuring the survivability of a team by providing health to heal the wounded and reviving the dead. A good medic greatly reduces the amount of time team members spend in Limbo or travelling from the spawn site.

## Medic Factoids

- A full energy bar is good for 4 med packs. Each med pack consumes 25% of an energy bar. Med packs are the only item which requires a medic to expend energy
- Each med pack heals 20 points of damage (assuming difficulty = 3)
- A medic starts out with 10 needles - these never get restocked unless you die and respawn
- When a team mate is revived, they regenerate back to 60 health
- Medics are the only class which regenerates health when wounded. You regenerate at approximately 2 points per second
- The number of medics on a team increase the starting health level of all team members as follows:

| Number of medics on team | Starting health (Medic) | Starting health (Other) |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 0                        | NA                      | 100                     |
| 1                        | 100                     | 110                     |
| 2                        | 123                     | 115                     |
| 3                        | 134                     | 120                     |
| 4+                       | 140                     | 125                     |



On the downside, medics start off with the least amount of ammunition. Each medic starts out with 30 rounds for the SMG (Thompson or MP40), 32 rounds for his pistol, and 1 grenade. Medics, if not supplied by a Lieutenant, need to practice a little bit of fire discipline when shooting back at the enemy (this means no full auto spray and pray).
