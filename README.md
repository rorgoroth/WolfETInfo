# Backup of net-clan Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory documentation

This is a backup of <https://www.net-clan.com/WolfWeb/> for historical/educational/archival purposes. Keep in mind this refered to the vanilla game as it was in 2007/v2.60b - but nothing has changed since then anyway.

Note: Some links are broken as the original pages are already missing from the web. 98% of it is here though.
