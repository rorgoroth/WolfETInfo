# Backup of net-clan Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory documentation.

This is a backup of https://www.net-clan.com/WolfWeb/ for historical/educational/archival  purposes. Keep in mind this refered to the vanilla game as it was in 2007 - but nothing has really changed much since then anyway.

One day I may get around to rewriting everything in markdown, but for now it's just straight html rips.

Note: Some links are broken as the original pages are already missing from the web. 98% of it is here though.
