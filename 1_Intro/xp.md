# What's This I Hear About Experience?

Enemy Territory has introduced a system by which players can gain additional abilities as they do their "job" and participate in the game. Every class has a set of four skills specific to them (Engineering, Signals, Heavy Weapons, Covert Ops, and Medical). Additionally, there are two other skill sets that are generic to all classes (Battle Sense and Light Weapons). To get a better sense for how the skill system works, read the PlayerGuide.html document inside the docs/ folder.

What I want to do now is just list the skills and describe what they do. The experience point levels and points earned per action might be slightly off, but the skill names and descriptions come courtesy of Activision. The format is:

\[Skill Level\]\[Name of Skill\]\[Experience Points Required\]\[Description\]

    Â  ![](mineid.jpg)

Of all the skills, Battle Sense is the "fuzziest". Well, McAfee and Popoco have spent a lot of time experimenting and drew the following conclusions:

The game awards battle sense to all the players every certain time (around 45 secs). We call this the "Battle Sense Timer". Basicly the game verifies if you were in the heat of battle and awards you points for it when the Battle Sense Timer expires.

How are the points awarded?

First of all, if you die before the timer expires you loose all the points you could have won. You have to succesfully complete that "Battle Session".

If you survive the Battle Session you get the following xp points:

2xp = If you give damage or recieve damage, but not both.  
5xp = If you give and recieve damage, but no kills.  
8xp = If you give and recieve damage, and you also kill someone.

> Notes:

\* If you die, you get no points.  
\* If you kill someone flawlessly, you still get 2xp.  
\* Situations cannot be duplicated. If you kill more people, or do even more damage, you still get the same Battle Sense.

## How Do Ranks Correspond To Experience?

Ranks are earned by increasing your skill levels. However, the rank system rewards the well rounded player who can excel at multiple classes as well as basic combat. I don't have a chart that maps skill levels to rank, but it seems that in order to reach Colonel, you need to reach level 4 in at least 2 classes, as well as level 4 in some other disciplines (light weapons and battle sense). If you just concentrate on one class and only gain skill there, you will be capped in rank but I'm not sure which one.

Here's how the progression works

*   Rank, up to Lieutenant, is determined by the level of your highest skill. Every skill level gained in that skill results in a promotion. You can attain a maximum rank of Lieutenant (4 promotions) if by maxing out in only one skill
*   To gain further promotions, you must reach level 4 in multiple skills

So an example of ranking up will be:

1.  Private-PVT/Schutze-STZ (no insignia) = (This is how you start)
2.  Private First Class-PFC/Oberschutze-OTZ (one chevron) = Level 1 in one skill
3.  Corporal-CPL/Gefreiter-GFR (two chevron) = Level 2 in one skill
4.  Sergeant-SGT/Feldwebel (three chevron) = Level 3 in one skill
5.  Lieutenant-LT/Leutnant-LTN (one silver bar) = Level 4 in one skill
6.  Captain-CPT/Hauptmann (two silver bars) = Level 4 in two skills
7.  Major-MAJ/Major (gold oak leaf) = Level 4 in three skills
8.  Colonel-COL/Oberst (eagle) = Level 4 in four skills
9.  Brigadier General-BGN/Generalmajor-GMJ (one star) = Level 4 in five skills
10.  Lieutenant General-LTG/Generalleutnant-GLT (two stars) = Level 4 in six skills
11.  General-GEN/General-GNL (three stars) = Level 4 in seven skills

## How Are The Medals Awarded At The End Of The Game?

There are 7 medals you can win. One corresponding to each class - you receive this if you were the person with the highest experience in that class at the end of each round - and one for light weapons and battle sense. Each medal is represented by an icon in your limbo menu or by a letter after your name in the end of game summary. The number of times a letter shows up represents how many times you've won that award. The letter corresponds to the first letter in the name of each skill:

C - Covert Ops (White)  
F - First Aid (Yellow)  
E - Engineering (Green)  
S - Signals (Blue)  
H - Heavy Weapons (Magenta)

B - Battle Sense (Red)  
L - Light Weapons (Light blue)

## How Will Server Admins Be Able To Customize The Experience System?

Currently, the only options server admins will have to customize experience is setting the number of rounds over which experience points and skills accrue to a player. Here are the current options:

1.  **Campaign** - 3 maps linked together. XP builds over all 3 games - and then resets at the next Campaign. Teams will see who wins each round... and then who wins the overall campaign. Even if team 'B' wins the first 2 rounds, the third map is still played to get overall scores (although team 'B' will be the winner).
2.  **SMO (Single Map Objective)** - Playing just 1 map to see who wins. After each game, XP is reset.
3.  **LMS (Last Man Standing)** - No objectives, no XP, no skills.
4.  **Stopwatch** - similar to SMO rounds. Skills and XP build, but after each round, the XP is reset. For example, I'm on Allies and get 2 promotions. Next round I'm on Axis with no promotions and trying to keep the other team from beating the time.
