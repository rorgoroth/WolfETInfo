</ol>
<p>A Covert Ops can steal a uniform from a slain enemy. When this happens, you
will see a &quot;grabbing&quot; icon show up. Hit activate and the status bar
will show you how much longer it will take before you have a new uniform.&nbsp;The
enemy soldier must be gibbed&nbsp; before the uniform can be taken, and you will
only have a few seconds until the gibbed body disappears into the ground.
However a not very well known fact is that you can still take the uniform after
the body disappears from view, even though no status bar will be displayed. Just
keep the activate key held down and wait. This looks like it is a bug in the
game.

<p>Once a uniform has been stolen, the enemy will literally look like you stole
his pants
<ol>
  <img alt="Image temporarily taken down - bandwidth getting overwhelmed" src="enemyfar.jpg" width="576" height="432">
</ol>
<p>When you see an enemy Covert Ops form a distance, you will see the class,
rank, and name of the person from whom the Covert Ops took the uniform.

</ol>
<p>If you move a little bit closer though, and the distance is still
considerable, then the class, rank, name information will disappear, letting you
know that they are not on your team.
<ol>

<p>If a friendly team member targets you, he will be warned with a huge red
symbol not to shoot you. The &quot;no-shoot&quot; symbol has been made more
prominent (thicker) in Final.</p>

<h4><font color="#ffffff">Other Tips For Covert Operators</font></h4>
<font color="#C0C0C0">
Here's a couple of things I've run across - most are pretty common sense, but I
thought I'd list them anyways.</font>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Most everyone already knows that if a field ops can
    see an enemy, they show up as icons in everyone's command map right? This
    can be useful when you are in scoped mode looking for people hiding behind
    things or in the trees. While in scoped mode, pull out your command map. It
    will show you where people are, even though you can't actually see them but
    they are still within your field of vision and not behind an object like a
    building. So, while you don't have a visual on them, you will see an icon
    representing where they are and their general facing so that all you have to
    do is wait for them to poke their little heads out.</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Also when a disguised Covert Ops is looked at by a
    Level 4 Field Op his icon reverts to his team colour on the maps and
    &quot;Enemy In Disguise&quot; is written above his heads where the players
    name should be.</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">A Covert Ops in disguise can pass through enemy-only
    doors. This is particularly helpful when accompanied by an engineer - you
    can get to some objectives very quickly</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">The Covert Ops' satchel charge is a much more
    efficient way of blowing thru obstacles enroute to the objective than using
    the engineer's dyno. It blows quicker and it doesn't use up the engineers
    charge bar.</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Scout around with your binoculars to <a href="mine.htm">spot
    and mark mines for your team</a></font></li>
