<h4><font color="#ffffff">What's A Fire Team?</font></h4>
<p>A fire team is a sub group within your overall team. You could create a fire
team based on defenders, a specific class, friends ... it's up to you. When you
belong to a fire team, there are some additional voice commands that are
available and team mates are highlighted to make it easier to keep track of them
in-screen and on the command map - adding to the level of coordination you can
exercise in-game.</p>
<h4><font color="#ffffff">The new HUD</font></h4>
<p><img hspace="10" src="fireteamhud.jpg" align="right" width="373" height="89">
The old HUD, showing the top 7 scorers, has been replaced with the fire team HUD.
The HUD still gives the basic information, but tailored to the set of people you
want to track. This way, you can create strike teams, watch a subset of
defenders, or just coordinate amongst your buddies. The HUD shows class, rank,
name, health, and the buddies grid coordiates.</p>
<p>For starters, make sure you have the a key bound to Fire Team Admin:
<p>&nbsp;
<ol>
  bind x &quot;mp_fireteamadmin&quot;
</ol>

<H4>So Why Create A Fireteam?</H4>
-->
<p>When you join a fire team, you can also use the command:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>selectbuddy (possible values of -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to show a fire team icon on top of the select buddy's head. To show the icon
over ALL team members' heads, use the value -2. -1 turns the icons off, and 1-6
selectively add the icon only to specified buddies. This is particularly useful
on dark maps and in thick vegetation. There are a total of 6 icons which
correspond to the 6 possible fire teams that can be formed.</p>
<p><img src="fireteam1.jpg" width="32" height="32"><img src="fireteam2.jpg" width="32" height="32"><img src="fireteam3.jpg" width="32" height="32"><img src="fireteam4.jpg" width="32" height="32"><img src="fireteam5.jpg" width="32" height="32"><img src="fireteam6.jpg" width="32" height="32"></p>
<p>I've created a simple script to toggle the team icons on and off:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>//Fireteam script - toggles buddy team icons<br>
  set showteam &quot;selectbuddy -2; set nextteamtoggle vstr hideteam; echo Team
  Highlighted!!!&quot;<br>
  set hideteam &quot;selectbuddy -1; set nextteamtoggle vstr showteam; echo Team
  icons hidden!!!&quot;<br>
  set nextteamtoggle &quot;vstr showteam&quot;<br>
  bind x &quot;vstr nextteamtoggle&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
