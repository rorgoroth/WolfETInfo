<h4><font color="#ffffff">What's This I Hear About Experience?</font></h4>
<font color="#C0C0C0">Enemy Territory has introduced a system by which players
can gain additional abilities as they do their &quot;job&quot; and participate
in the game. Every class has a set of four skills specific to them (Engineering,
Signals, Heavy Weapons, Covert Ops, and Medical). Additionally, there are two
other skill sets that are generic to all classes (Battle Sense and Light
Weapons). To get a better sense for how the skill system works, read the
PlayerGuide.html document inside the docs/ folder.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">What I want to do now is just list the skills and
describe what they do. The experience point levels and points earned per action
might be slightly off, but the skill names and descriptions come courtesy of
Activision. The format is:</font>

<p>Of all the skills, Battle Sense is the &quot;fuzziest&quot;. Well, McAfee and
Popoco have spent a lot of time experimenting and drew the following
conclusions:
<ol>
  <p>The game awards battle sense to all the players every certain time (around
  45 secs). We call this the &quot;Battle Sense Timer&quot;. Basicly the game
  verifies if you were in the heat of battle and awards you points for it when
  the Battle Sense Timer expires.
  <p>How are the points awarded?
  <p>First of all, if you die before the timer expires you loose all the points
  you could have won. You have to succesfully complete that &quot;Battle
  Session&quot;.
  <p>If you survive the Battle Session you get the following xp points:
  <p>&nbsp;
  <ol>
    2xp = If you give damage or recieve damage, but not both.<br>
    5xp = If you give and recieve damage, but no kills.<br>
    8xp = If you give and recieve damage, and you also kill someone.
  </ol>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <p>Notes:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <ol>
    * If you die, you get no points.<br>
    * If you kill someone flawlessly, you still get 2xp.<br>
    * Situations cannot be duplicated. If you kill more people, or do even more
    damage, you still get the same Battle Sense.

<a name="ranks"></a>
<h4><font color="#ffffff">How Do Ranks Correspond To Experience?</font></h4>
Ranks are earned by increasing your skill levels. However, the rank system
rewards the well rounded player who can excel at multiple classes as well as
basic combat. I don't have a chart that maps skill levels to rank, but it seems
that in order to reach Colonel, you need to reach level 4 in at least 2 classes,
as well as level 4 in some other disciplines (light weapons and battle sense).
If you just concentrate on one class and only gain skill there, you will be
capped in rank but I'm not sure which one.
<p>Here's how the progression works
<ul>
  <li>Rank, up to Lieutenant, is determined by the level of your highest skill.
    Every skill level gained in that skill results in a promotion. You can
    attain a maximum rank of Lieutenant (4 promotions) if by maxing out in only
    one skill
  <li>To gain further promotions, you must reach level 4 in multiple skills</li>
</ul>
<p>So an example of ranking up will be:
<ol>
  <li>Private-PVT/Schutze-STZ (no insignia) = (This is how you start)
  <li>Private First Class-PFC/Oberschutze-OTZ (one chevron) = Level 1 in one
    skill
  <li>Corporal-CPL/Gefreiter-GFR (two chevron) = Level 2 in one skill
  <li>Sergeant-SGT/Feldwebel (three chevron) = Level 3 in one skill
  <li>Lieutenant-LT/Leutnant-LTN (one silver bar) = Level 4 in one skill
  <li>Captain-CPT/Hauptmann (two silver bars) = Level 4 in two skills
  <li>Major-MAJ/Major (gold oak leaf) = Level 4 in three skills
  <li>Colonel-COL/Oberst (eagle) = Level 4 in four skills
  <li>Brigadier General-BGN/Generalmajor-GMJ (one star) = Level 4 in five skills
  <li>Lieutenant General-LTG/Generalleutnant-GLT (two stars) = Level 4 in six
    skills
  <li>General-GEN/General-GNL (three stars) = Level 4 in seven skills</li>
</ol>
<a name="medals"></a>
<h4><font color="#ffffff">How Are The Medals Awarded At The End Of The Game?</font></h4>
There are 7 medals you can win. One corresponding to each class - you receive
this if you were the person with the highest experience in that class at the end
of each round - and one for light weapons and battle sense. Each medal is
represented by an icon in your limbo menu or by a letter after your name in the
end of game summary. The number of times a letter shows up represents how many
times you've won that award. The letter corresponds to the first letter in the
name of each skill:
<ol>
  <font color="#ffffff">C - Covert Ops (White)</font><br>
  <font color="yellow">F - First Aid (Yellow)</font><br>
  <font color="green">E - Engineering (Green)</font><br>
  <font color="blue">S - Signals (Blue)</font><br>
  <font color="magenta">H - Heavy Weapons (Magenta)</font>
  <p><font color="red">B - Battle Sense (Red)</font><br>
  <font color="cyan">L - Light Weapons (Light blue)</font><br>
  </p>
</ol>
<a name="match"></a>
<h4><font color="#ffffff">How Will Server Admins Be Able To Customize The
Experience System?</font></h4>
Currently, the only options server admins will have to customize experience is
setting the number of rounds over which experience points and skills accrue to a
player. Here are the current options:
<ol>
  <li><font color="#ffffff"><b>Campaign</b> - 3</font> maps linked together. XP
    builds over all 3 games - and then resets at the next Campaign. Teams will
    see who wins each round... and then who wins the overall campaign. Even if
    team 'B' wins the first 2 rounds, the third map is still played to get
    overall scores (although team 'B' will be the winner).
  <li><b><font color="#ffffff">SMO</font> (Single Map Objective)</b> - Playing
    just 1 map to see who wins. After each game, XP is reset.
  <li><b><font color="#ffffff">LMS</font> (Last Man Standing)</b> - No
    objectives, no XP, no skills.
  <li><b><font color="#ffffff">Stopwatch</font></b> - similar to SMO rounds.
    Skills and XP build, but after each round, the XP is reset. For example, I'm
    on Allies and get 2 promotions. Next round I'm on Axis with no promotions
    and trying to keep the other team from beating the time.</li>
</ol>
