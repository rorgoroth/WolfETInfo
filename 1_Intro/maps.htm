width=200 border=0> <BR>The Axis base lies just on the other side. 
<P>The first map in the North Africa campaign is set near an old desert city, 
and tasks the Allies with blowing up two anti-tank guns deep within an Axis 
stronghold. The Allies can go in by force, blowing up a wall in the old city, or 
take a stealthier route, using tunnels under the city that must first be drained 
using water pumps. 
<P>A central spawn point can be found in the Old City, next to the second water 
pump and a room with health and ammo. Once through the wall, the two anti-tank 
guns can be found on the second floor at the very rear of the Axis post. 
Engineers will need to arm dynamite on each gun, and protect it for 30 seconds 
until it detonates. 
<P><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Allies</B>:</FONT> The Axis initially spawn in the Old 
City, so you want to take this point as fast as possible. You'll need as much 
time as possible to attack the Axis post, so you don't want to find yourself 
making time-consuming runs from your initial camp to the Old City. Don't worry 
about the command post; don't worry about the water pumps; just take the Old 
City spawn point first, hold it for 30 seconds, and you'll be free do build 
everything else without distraction. 
<P>- In some cases, you might get lucky and a team of Axis newbies may leave the 
Old City relatively unguarded; otherwise, you can hug the route to the left, 
which eventually leads to the roof of the bunker. Chuck in a few grenades, and 
try to time your rush so that you reach the flag just as the respawn timer kicks 
in. With any luck, your team will spawn in right after you touch the flag, 
before any remaining Axis enemies can reclaim the room. Wipe them out, and the 
true assault can commence. 
<P>- Once you've breached the wall, the Axis will usually fall back and begin 
protecting the rear area of the compound. You should make sure the tunnels are 
drained, forcing the Axis to split their focus on two possible entryways. Axis 
Engineers will usually start planting mines in the rear yard, but you can avoid 
many of them by <I>not</I> taking the staircases directly in front of the 
anti-tank guns; instead, there's a ladder underneath a mounted MG42 in the yard 
that leads to the second floor. 
<P><IMG height=150 src="16s.jpg" width=200 border=0> <BR>This is a good spot for 
the Axis to watch over the anti-tank guns. 
<P><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Axis</B>:</FONT> One of the most common mistakes I've 
seen is for Axis teams to immediately scatter and leave the Old City spawn point 
unguarded. STOOOOPID!! It's a relatively easy room to defend, and the longer you 
hold this room, the longer you can stave off the full Allied assault. There's a 
health and ammo room right next door, and I've managed to hold down this room 
for extended periods single-handedly. Don't give it up without a fight! 
<P>- Once the Allies have breached the wall, your defenses should revolve around 
the rear compound area. Mine the rear yard like crazy, especially the areas in 
front of the staircases leading up to the two guns. Make use of the mounted 
MG42, as well as several prime camping spots near the anti-tank guns. 
<P>- It's to your advantage to have the Allies spend as much time running back 
and forth before sending them back to limbo, so don't worry about moving forward 
to the Old City so you can shoot them the second they respawn -- hang back and 
play defense, and you should be able to fight the Allies off. <BR><BR><A

<BR>Getting up this hill will NOT be easy. 
<P>The second North Africa map is an uphill beachhead assault, and requires the 
Allies to destory a set of gun controls inside an Axis stronghold. The Allies 
have two routes they can take: the main one up the beachhead requires an 
Engineer to build an access ramp, and a secondary path leads to the back of the 
bunker, where a disguised Covert Ops player can sneak in through a back door. 
<P>Either route is a rough one: a west bunker with mounted MG42s overlooks the 
main hill, and the Axis will often call in airstrikes to keep the Allies from 
getting out of the water. The secondary side path is also watched over by a rear 
bunker, and a narrow path that can be easily mined. 
<P>Towards the back of the bunker, a generator can be destroyed by either an 
Engineer's dynamite or Covert Ops' satchel charge. Once the generator is 
destroyed, numerous doors within the stronghold will open, including a rear door 
that allows access to the rest of the Allied squad. The interior of the base can 
be a maze; follow the blue signs to get to the Seawall Gun. 
<P><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Allies</B>:</FONT> There are a few approaches that can 
be used for your initial attack. The first is to build the access ramp and gain 
control of the West bunker as quickly as possible. This is easier said than 
done: there are mounted MG42s overlooking the beachhead, and if the Axis are 
using air support, it can sometimes be hard to even get out of the water. 
<P>- Once you have access to the West bunker, it's imperative that someone stays 
behind to guard it -- it will allow you to send wave after wave of soldiers into 
the heart of the Axis installation without having to retake the beachhead. 
<P>- The more stealthy approach is to use the alternate spawn point and send in 
a Covert Ops class in the back door. First, you'll need to steal an enemy 
uniform and successfully make it to the back door -- no simple task if any Axis 
are paying attention at the rear bunker. Once inside, you can blow up the 
generator with a satchel charge. You can't blow up the cannon with your satchel, 
but you <I>can</I> guard the generator in case an Axis engineer comes up to fix 
it. If you manage to succeed, signal to your team immeditately -- it's a lot 
easier to attack from the rear bunker than the West. 
<P>- If you're unable to get a Covert Ops player in the back door, you'll have 
to go in by force. A Soldier with a flamethrower is useful for clearing out the 
front rooms -- just watch out for the mounted MG42 near the entrance. Have a 
Medic nearby to heal fallen teammates, and you should you should be able to 
sneak in an Engineer during a lull in the fighting. 
<P><IMG height=150 src="04s.jpg" width=200 border=0> <BR>A view overlooking the 
seawall gun. 
<P><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Axis</B>:</FONT> The best starting strategy is to send 
one, maybe two Engineers to patrol the back pathway, mining the area and 
shooting <I>anyone</I> who comes down the narrow passageway. <I>Everyone</I> 
else should focus on the front beachhead and keep the Allies from building the 
access ramp as long as possible. Using air support, mortars and mounted guns, 
it's possible to hold off the Allies for the entire match; the longer you can 
keep them at bay, the less time they have to make their real assault. 
<P>- At the beginning of the match, the worst thing you can do is to let an 
Allied Covert Ops sneak in the back. If you get killed on the beachhead, it 
should be at the very top where players won't have time to steal your uniform. 
And there's absolutely no reason to open the back door -- don't do it! 
<P>- If the Allies have taken the front bunker, protect the hallway which acts 
as a nice chokepoint, watched over by the MG42. Have Medics nearby to keep your 
guards healthy, and you should be able to keep the Allies out for a while. 
You'll also want to have at least a few soldiers near the gun controls, in case 
someone gets close enough to plant dynamite. 
<P>- Basically <B><I>DON'T GO OUT THE BACK DOOR OR ONTO THE 
BEACH!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR></I></B><A href="maps.htm#top"><BR>Back to Top</A>

<P><FONT color=#ffffff size=4><U><A name=Gold><B>Gold Rush</B></A></U></FONT> 
<BR><IMG height=150 src="10s.jpg" width=200 border=0> <BR>Your initial 
objective: a Jagdpanther tank. 
<P>Maybe the best map of the group, "Gold Rush" is a tense affair set in the 
narrow streets of a North Africa village. The Allies need to first commandeer a 
tank and drive it along a preset path, using Engineers to blow up any barricades 
that may be in their way. You don't actually "drive" the tank; it will move on 
its own whenever an Allied player stands next to it. 
<P>Once the tank has arrived at its final destination in a lower courtyard, it 
will blow a hole in a side of a bank, where the Allies need to steal two crates 
of gold, load them onto a truck, and drive it back to their initial spawn point. 

<P>Adding to the difficulty: at any point, the Axis can damage the tank or the 
truck, requiring repairs before either can continue moving. The courtyard where 
the truck is located happens to be right outside an Axis spawn point, so the 
task of getting the gold out to the truck and driving off to victory is no mean 
feat. 
<P><IMG height=150 src="11s.jpg" width=200 border=0> <BR>When starting, don't 
get sidetracked -- head to the left. 
<P><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Allies</B>:</FONT> There's no complex strategy to this 
map; you simply need to <I>work as a team</I>. Don't get sidetracked fixing the 
truck or blowing up truck barricades until you've taken control of the tank and 
gotten it down to the lower courtyard.<BR><BR>- Stealing the tank can be tough, 
as the Axis initially spawn in right next to the tank and will often call in 
airstrikes to the approaching area. Use airstrikes of your own to soften Axis 
defenses, and then rush your Engineers in to fix the tank and get it moving ... 
which will claim that spawn point for the Allies. If it takes longer than five 
minutes to take the tank, you're in trouble.<BR><BR>- Once you have the area 
under control, have an Engineer take control of the command post. Since it's 
right outside the Allied spawn point, you should be able to easily control this 
post for the remainder of the map.<BR><BR>- As you first begin moving the tank, 
send in a few Engineers to blow the first tank barricade (assuming it has been 
built by the Axis). You should be able to provide solid cover with the 
Jagdpanther's assault gun.<BR><BR>- The escort down to the lower courtyard only 
gets tougher as you get further away from your spawn point. If you can get a 
hold of the two mounted MG42s in the lower courtyards, you'll be in good shape, 
as they overlook most of the exits from the Axis spawn point.<BR><BR>- A key 
moment is when the tank arrives at the location of the second barricade. If it 
has been built, the Jagdpanther's gun is fantastic for clearing out Axis 
players, and combined with the MG42, should provide cover for your engineer to 
plant dynamite and destroy the barricade. I've noticed that you can often tell 
how a match is going by how much time is left when the Allies break into the 
bank. Breaking into the bank in 10 minutes is a good sign; 15 means you're in 
for a fight, and 20 minutes means you're in trouble.<BR><BR>- Once you've broken 
into the bank, odds are the entire Axis team will set up shop inside, and 
getting in and out with the gold will not be easy. Take control of the MG42 
overlooking the courtyard to take care of any Axis that may wander out, and then 
send in a few other soldiers to fight for the bank. A Panzerfaust blast and a 
few grenades may soften things up enough to steal a crate, and having a medic or 
two nearby isn't a bad idea, either.<BR><BR>- When you've secured both crates on 
the truck, send in an Engineer to repair it and get it moving. Odds are, Axis 
players will come rushing out and straight up the hill; a Soldier camping near 
the first truck barricade with a mobile MG42 can rack up tons of kills in no 
time. After this, it should be relatively smooth sailing the rest of the way to 
the exit.<BR><BR><IMG height=150 src="12s.jpg" width=200 border=0> <BR>Once the 
bank is open, the Axis should always have someone protecting it with a mobile 
MG42. 
<P><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Axis</B>:</FONT> Like the Allies, the worst thing you 
can do on this map is scramble around. Concentrate all your energy on defending 
one spot at a time.<BR><BR>- The initial goal should be to retain control of the 
tank and the forward spawn point for as long as possible. As long as everyone 
stays in the tank area, you should be able to keep Engineers at bay for a while. 
Call in airstrikes, build your command post and hold your position for as long 
as you can.<BR><BR>- One exception: one Engineer should build the two tank 
barricades ASAP; the first barricade is especially hard to build once the Allies 
have the tank and rush the area. <BR><BR>- After the Allies have taken the tank, 
the Axis respawn in a lower courtyard. Control both MG42s overlooking the area, 
and mining both barricades will slow the Allies down. Use airstrikes and 
Panzerfaust blasts to damage the tank, and then rush in to protect it so no 
Engineers can fix it.<BR><BR>- A crucial moment in this map occurs when the tank 
arrives at the lower barricade. the Axis need to OWN this area, especially right 
behind the tank. Protect this area vigorously so the Allies can't blow up the 
barricade or fix the tank. 
<P><IMG height=150 src="08s.jpg" width=200 border=0> <BR>Don't let them escape 
with the truck! 
<P>- Once the tank passes the second barricade, don't wait for the tank to blow 
open the bank -- get to the rear entrance ASAP, and once the bank is open, the 
entire Axis team should collapse around it. You should have soldiers in every 
corner of the room, and definitely a few mobile MG42s. If the Allies get both 
gold crates more than 5 minutes left, you're basically screwed.<BR><BR>- If time 
is winding down and the Allies are driving away with the gold, you may be able 
to steal a few seconds by hitting the truck with a rocket, and then send in a 
few players with flamethrowers to protect it. But let's be honest: if the Allies 
have gotten this far, they're eventually going to get the truck moving again. 
Your only hope is that time will run out ... or you'll have to try and do better 
on the Central Europe maps. # <BR><A href="maps.htm#top"><BR>Back to Top</A>

border=0><BR>A view of the Axis yard.<BR><BR>Set in the mountains, the Allies' 
task here is to break into an Axis base and steal the circuit boards from two 
new radar dishes for analysis. Each of the boards sits underneath a radar dish 
in plain sight in the Axis courtyard.<BR><BR>The main entrance to the Axis base 
will need to be demolished by an Engineer, a task made easier once the Allies 
have claimed a forward bunker. There's also a side bunker to the east with a 
command post that can be blown open by an Engineer, which allows a slightly 
sneakier approach.<BR><BR>Once a circuit board has been taken, the Allies need 
to secure it to a truck waiting just outside the Axis base (near the forward 
bunker). This is no mean feat, as the Axis yard is fairly open and loaded with 
sniping spots, and escape can be extremely difficult.<BR><BR><FONT 
color=#ffffff><B>Allies</B>:</FONT> First things first: take the forward bunker 
<I>immediately</I>. You'll need all the time you've got to retrieve both sets of 
radar parts, so don't waste time fighting over the forward bunker -- take it 
forcefully and decisively.<BR><BR>- The only exception: you might want to send 
one or two Engineers to the side bunker ASAP, so they can blow up the door 
before any Axis arrive there. If you time things correctly, you could 
potentially steal a set of radar parts and arrive at the front entrance just as 
the rest of your team is blowing it open.<BR><BR>- Once the forward bunker is 
taken, the Allies' best chance of success is to split the Axis defenses. The 
Axis can protect the front entrance all day, so make sure you maintain a hold on 
the side bunker. From here, it's a lot easier to get to the East parts if you go 
around the back of the garage; you'll often find Axis soldiers waiting in the 
grass with their backs turned to you.<BR><BR>- Similarly, you'll probably 
encounter less resistance getting to the West parts if you go the long way 
behind the garage and the main Axis building. Use your sprint ability only where 
you need to, and rest a few seconds before grabbing the part; odds are, a few 
soldiers are fighting it out at the front entrance, and when the moment is 
right, you can grab the part and make a burst for the main entrance and the 
truck.<BR><BR>- Of course, you don't want to leave the main entrance completely 
empty; two or three soldiers, at least one mobile MG42, and continued airstrikes 
should help keep things clear.<BR><BR><IMG height=150 src="18s.jpg" width=200 
border=0> <BR>The Allies claim the forward bunker.<BR><BR><FONT 
color=#ffffff><B>Axis</B>:</FONT> Your first objective is to hold the forward 
base, including the junction outside that leads to the side base. Holding this 
area can keep the Allies off balance indefinitely ... and keep them from going 
after the radar parts.<BR><BR>- Even if you lose the forward base, you can put a 
major crimp in the Allied assault by maintaining control of the side base. Send 
an Engineer and a few soldiers to watch over the entrance to make sure the 
Allies don't blow it open. Unless the Allies send an entire squad of Engineers, 
laying a few landmines should stall their progress on the side base greatly. 
Retaining this base allows the rest of your team to concentrate on guarding the 
main entrance -- and you can defend that entrance all day if necessary.<BR><BR>- 
Once the main entrance is blown open, playing defense comes down to positioning. 
The three key points you want to defend are the main entrance, and the two radar 
parts. Thankfully, the yard offers a few prime spots to cover multiple areas at 
once, including a guard tower and a window overlooking the yard.<BR><BR>- If 
someone manages to grab a set of parts, don't panic and start scrambling around; 
maintain your defensive positions. There are only two ways in and out of the 
Axis base, and by now, you should have them well-covered. If you were watching 
over a stolen part, get to the front entrance and try to ambush the thief when 
he attempts to secure the part to the truck. <BR><BR><A href="maps.htm#top">Back to

Gun</B><BR></A></U></FONT><IMG height=150 src="20s.jpg" width=200 
border=0><BR><BR>Another excellent map, "Rail Gun" is set in a snowy train yard, 
and the only map in the group that casts the Axis in an offensive role. Arranged 
in a triangular layout with a bunker in the center, the Axis must guide a train 
along a track to a depot, load it with ammo, guide it back to their starting 
point, and then load the ammo into a massive railgun and fire it.<BR><BR>Like 
the tank from "Gold Rush," the train will move on its own once a player stands 
inside it ... except it will change directions depending on what team the player 
is on. As a result, the map plays out like a huge game of football, with both 
teams constantly pushing the train back and forth.<BR><BR>An MG42 nest overlooks 
the midpoint of the track, which also has a track switch that can raised or 
lowered by any player, either allowing the train to pass through ... or 
preventing its progress. The train depot features a spawn point that can be 
controlled by either team, and the central bunker contains health kits, ammo, 
and a command post.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Allies</B>:</FONT> At the 
start, it's all about the track switch. Build the MG42 nest ASAP and don't let 
that train through, no matter what.<BR><BR>- Mine the track switch. If someone 
drives the train up to the switch, kill them and drive it back. With enough 
soldiers, you should be able to cover this area pretty well and block Axis 
progress indefinitely.<BR><BR>- If the Axis somehow get through and load up the 
train, you're still in good shape … but you need to OWN the train depot. Your 
entire team should immediately collapse on the train depot and take the spawn 
point; from here, you can respawn right in front of the train and set up another 
solid defense. There's an MG42 nest to cover the two paths from the north, and 
planting mines will also help. there's also a catwalk to the southeast that can 
be used to ambush Axis that may try to go through the bunker to get to the train 
depot.<BR><BR>- And if the Axis somehow load up the train and take the train 
depot spawn point … just collapse back to the center point and don't let the 
Axis through. If you can hold each of these three positions for 10 minutes, 
you'll be OK.<BR><BR>- If all else fails, you can still destroy the gun controls 
and prevent the Axis from firing the rail gun. It's not easy, but if you can get 
your entire team to the rail gun, you may be able to delay things for a few 
minutes until time runs out.<BR><BR><IMG height=150 src="22s.jpg" width=200 
border=0> <BR>Controllihg the track switch area is key. <BR><BR><FONT 
color=#ffffff><B>Axis</B>:</FONT> You've got your work cut out for you. It can 
be very, very hard to break through the Allied defenses, and if they're strong 
enough, they may even collapse around your core spawn point.<BR><BR>- As in 
"Gold Rush," it's essential that you move as a team and focus on one objective 
at a time; it will be very hard for your team to get the train around the track 
if one group is fighting in the bunker, another is trying to take the train 
depot, and others are off doing who-knows-what. (Hey, we've seen guys camping at 
the Axis base protecting the gun controls; we're not sure what they're 
thinking.)<BR><BR>- Your first task should be to get to get the train through 
the track switch, which requires a combined effort, as the Allied spawn point is 
pretty close by. There are a few things you can do to help: destroy the hilltop 
MG42 nest with a rocket; use the bunker's MG42 to clear Allied soldiers from the 
stairs; have another soldier protect the main entrance to the bunker. Everyone 
else should escort the train; with enough of an escort, you should be able to 
raise the switch just as the train approaches.<BR><BR>- Once you're through the 
track switch, lower it ASAP. You haven't really achieved anything on this map 
until you've loaded the ammo onto the tug, so make the train gets to the depot 
OK. Half the Axis team should stick with the train, and the other half should 
set out to capture the train depot.<BR><BR><IMG height=150 src="19s.jpg" 
width=200 border=0> <BR>Once you have the train depot, load the ammo and go. 
<BR><BR>- After the ammo is loaded on the tug, it's time to head back. Repeat 
your initial assault on the track switch -- it will take everything you've got 
to break through, so don't get sidetracked worrying about anything else. Watch 
the train and make sure someone is there to raise the switch when it 
approaches.<BR><BR>- Once the train gets back to your yard, you'll need to load 
the ammo onto a second tug, load it into the railgun, and fire it. If the gun 
controls are busted, THIS is the time to fix them. Send everyone you have to the 
controls -- if the Allies have entrenched themselves, there's a tower in front 
of your base that you can use to snipe at them. Fix the controls, fire the gun 
and you win! <BR><BR><A href="maps.htm#top">Back to Top</A>

<BR><IMG height=150 src="05s.jpg" width=200 border=0> <BR>The Allies need to 
escort this tank up to the Axis base.<BR><BR>The last map in the group is also 
one of the toughest for the Allies. Set in the snowy mountains, the Allies need 
to use a tank to blast their way into an Axis camp, and then blow up their fuel 
depot. Before that, however, the Allies need to build a bridge over a frozen 
river, which will be heavily defended by the Axis.<BR><BR>Once through the first 
wall, the Allies assume control of the forward spawn point, and can drive the 
tank through a series of caves before reaching the Axis base, which is watched 
over by two MG42s. Once the main entrance is blown up, the tank can be driven 
around back to open up a second entrance to the base. The fuel depot is located 
all the way at the rear of the Axis installation, and cannot be accessed until 
one of two gates is blown up.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Allies</B>:</FONT> 
This can be a tough map for the Allies. If the Axis are strong, they can set up 
tons of defenses and rip your team to shreds before you can even get near the 
bridge construction area. In this case, you'll need some snipers to take out the 
long-range gunners, and Engineers who can work quickly.<BR><BR>- There's a side 
route where the Allies can build a footbridge. My advice: ignore it. It's no 
easier to get across than the main bridge, and taking this route will only 
weaken your main attack.<BR><BR>- Once you've reached the main Axis base, 
concentrate on keeping the two MG42 nests and the connecting catwalk clear, and 
you'll save yourself a lot of grief. Drive the tank around to open up the 
secondary entrance, which does two things: it forces the Axis to concentrate on 
two different entrances, and the tank's MG42 also has a nice view of the area 
from here, including rooftops that may have snipers. This is where you'll want 
to concentrate your assault.<BR><BR>- One underhanded bit of strategy: it's 
possible for an Engineer and Covert Ops to work together and infiltrate the Axis 
base without the tank ever reaching the Axis base. Once the side grate is blown 
open, simply (a) send the two through the side entrance; (b) kill an Axis 
soldier and have the Covert Ops guy steal his uniform; (c) have the disguised 
Covert Ops player open the door to the Axis base and let the Engineer inside. If 
the Axis are totally focused on stopping the tank -- which they usually are 
early on -- they may leave their rear base totally unguarded, making it child's 
play at this point to blow up the fuel depot for an easy win.<BR><BR><IMG 
height=150 src="07s.jpg" width=200 border=0> <BR>Flying soldiers are a common 
sight on this map.<BR><BR><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Axis</B>:</FONT> It is more 
than possible for the Axis to defend this map and never let the tank cross the 
bridge. Build your guard tower, set up a few mobile MG42s, bring in a sniper, 
and call in constant airstrikes. The tunnel down by the river makes a nice 
camping spot -- it has a nice view of the bridge construction point.<BR><BR>- 
Once the Allies have reached the front entrance, you have lots of defensive 
options. The most important is to completely mine the areas in front of the fuel 
depot, and have at least one soldier and Engineer someone watching over the area 
at all times. The roof of the Axis base is a good place for this.<BR><BR>- The 
rest of your defenses should be concentrated on the two main entrances. It takes 
a LONG time for the Allies to make the run from the forward base to yours, so 
there's no excuse for not having a solid defense. You don't have to run through 
the caves -- just have soldiers lurking next to the exits.<BR><BR>- Whatever you 
do, don't get caught by the Allies' Covert Ops/Engineer strategy. If someone 
sets the dynamite at your fuel depot while you're still defending the bridge, do 
whatever it takes to get back there ASAP -- even if that means sitting on your 
own grenade and respawning as an Engineer.<BR><BR>That's it! Remember, the best 
teams are the ones that work together, and you can always check the objectives 
for each map in the Limbo menu. Work hard enough, and you just might achieve 
eternal glory! </P>

<BR> The Allies have to take the truck to this barrier, capture the flag, then
blow the barrier, as well as a second barrier next to the flag. </P>

<P>They then have to escort the truck round to the main depot, with a side of
objective of a command post, where the allies can spawn. At the main depot,
there is a front gate, and two side walls, all of which can be blown by
engineers. There is also an Axis only door, which can make coverts useful. </P>

<P>The final part of the map is possibly the hardest. The Allies have to escort
the truck round to the back of the base, where there is a crane. They then have
to construct the crane controls, press the button and escort the truck away. The
exit point for the truck is just next to the command post. </P>

<P><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Allies</B>:</FONT> Because this is a custom map, and
designed mainly for competition use, it is offensively biased, meaning this map
isn't too hard for the Allies.<BR><BR>- There are lots of different ways to
reach the first bunker, my personal favourite being the tunnels. All in all
there are 4 different ways, the only 1 I would not recommend is the route the
truck takes, as Axis crossfire is often concentrated on this ares.<BR><BR>- Once
you reach the bunker, and capture the flag it is relatively easy to get a plant
down, as long as there are no axis remaining your side of the gate. This is
because the Axis only have 1 way in, which is through a door. This is easily
covered by just 1 or 2 people. However be aware because usually Axis won't come
through the door, just throw grenades through it.<BR><BR>- As soon as the bottom
gate is blown, Axis will usually have another crossfire set up, so it is
advisable to blow the top door as soon as possible to give you 2 angels of
attack. Once this is done, the best route is once again through the tunnels, as
the Axis defence is usually centred on the command post. Once you have planted
at the gate, this will disorganise their command post defence, allowing you to
get in and build it. This command post is vital, because it provides the Allies
with a spawn that is much closer to the final objective. </P>

<P>- It is a good idea to blow the side walls, because the main gate is another
good spot for an axis crossfire, especially if they are co-ordinated. Also it
gives easier access to the truck when the gold is taken.<BR><BR>- There isn't
really a best way to get the gold, because there are only 2. The main way is
past the axis spawn, which is under the complex, up a set of spiral stairs and
into the control room, the secondary way is where the truck ends, you have to
blow up the depot fence, which is satchelable, this is assuming the Axis have
built it, the climb up a ramp to the back of the complex, the you have to walk
round a bit until you reach the controls.<BR><BR>- Once the controls are
activated the best route to take is down the left hand side, through the hole in
the east wall, and round the back towards the truck, It is also a good idea to
set up a spawn kill at this point to stop the Axis getting near the truck,
giving you an easy ride to the end. </P>

<img src="supply2.jpg">
<br>
This is the view from near the command post, towards the depot gate, it is also a good spot to cover any plant from.
<br>
<br>
<FONT color=#ffffff><B>Axis</B>: </FONT><font color="#C0C0C0">As I said before
this is an offensively biased map, so Axis will have a hard time defending here.</font>

<P>- The most important thing to do for the start of the map is to set your
spawn to spawn point 3. This is because there is a bug in the map which can
cause you to spawn at the back, even if you have selected to spawn at the flag.
You can do this by typing /setspawnpt 3 in the console. </P>

<P>- The best bet for full holding this map is to try and keep the 1st stage for
as long as possible. This can be done with good crossfire in the lower bunker,
and good teamwork, so someone always keeps an eye on the high route.<BR><BR>- A
good trick to do at the start is to drop down into the tunnels, you can beat the
allies to them, and throw a grenade. This can take out a large number of Allies
and they wont expect it.<BR><BR>- If the flag is captured, and you have spawned
at the back then there isn't really much point in pushing forward and trying to
reclaim it. Just set up a crossfire for when the gate is blown, construct the
command post and place a few mines in areas such as in front of the command
post, and around the depot gate and tunnel exit.

<br>- Once this stage has been broken, you should really try to stay inside the
depot, then it is much harder for them to gib you, and providing you have good
medics there is very little chance you will have to spawn for a while. Also this
stops any covert ops taking your uniform and sneaking into the base.<BR><BR>-
When the gate is blown, you should fall back to the top of the complex, around
the crane controls room. A common tactic, and one which works well is to have a
flamethrower at the top of the stairs, this is usually quite effective, but will
require good team play as medics need to be quick to revive and field ops need
to give him a constant supply of ammo. </P>

<P>
<img src="supply3.jpg">
<br>
The Axis don't want this to happen if they can help it.<BR><BR>- If they manage to construct the
controls, then it can be a good idea to switch to covert ops quickly, either to
blow up the controls before they can press them, this usually only happens if
all of the Allies died in their attack, or you can satchel the command post,
which means they have to spawn at the flag, which then takes them longer to get
to the truck, and thus longer to complete the map. </P>

<BR> <font color="#C0C0C0"> The Allied team has to blow up the coolant controls, to drain both of these
towers.
<br>
<br>
On this map, the Allies have a large variety of objectives, and plenty of ways to do them.
<br>
<br>
This map is once again offensively biased, as most custom maps are, and the Allies 1st objective is to
blow the main gate. They have to do this by taking a crate of explosives to a
truck, repairing the truck and then allowing it to automatically drive into the
gate. They then have to capture the flag just behind the gate.</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">They then have to blow the coolant controls, either by
crawling through the vent, or by blowing one of the side doors to gain access to
the towers. Once on of these is blown, the flag is secured by the allies.</font></p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">If the controls are destroyed, and the axis rebuild
them before the liquid is drained, then the tower will be gin to refill itself.
But if the tower is drained successfully, then its cannot be refilled, and the
second tower will begin to drain.</font></p>
<p><FONT color=#ffffff><B>Allies</B>:</FONT>  The Allies main objective is the
coolant controls. They can be satcheled, so engineers are very rarely used in
the final stage of this map.</p>

<font color="#C0C0C0">

-&nbsp; The 1st, and probably most useful tip for this map is to always have a
covert on your team, even at the start. The covert can sneak through an axis
only door which is just next to the gate at any time with a suit, and can then
go on to destroy the controls. You will usually find a panzer/mg on this map so
using the sniper rifle is quite a good idea.&nbsp;
<br><br>
-&nbsp;The best bet for Allies is to get the parts 1st, then build the truck, as
without them the truck is useless. However, the truck is pretty much
un-destroyable so it doesn't really matter in which order you do this.
<br><br>
-&nbsp;Once the truck has rammed the gate, capturing the flag is quite easy.
Once this has happened, its a good idea to go straight through the vent to try
and catch the Axis team off guard, however if they spot you, the vent is a
dangerous place to be as you cannot strafe, and any kind of panzer/rifle grenade
will kill you easily.
<br><br>
-&nbsp;The doors are also easy to blow up, and quite important as the Axis will
sometimes try to reclaim the flag.
<br><br>
-&nbsp;Once you get to this stage, you will find very few Axis outside of the
bunker room, so blowing the controls can be quite difficult. Also you will find
engineers trying desperately to repair the controls, and diving in regardless of
whether people are still shooting them or not.
<br><br>
-&nbsp;A good idea, if you have enough charge bar, is to lay another satchel on
the controls after your original one, to get the engineer as he tries to repair
them.</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="#C0C0C0">
-&nbsp;A final point is that on this map, spawn killing on the final phase is
pretty much impossible so don't even bother trying it.</font>
<p><font color="#ffffff"><b>Axis</b>:</font> The Axis objective for this map is
simply to stop the Allies achieving theirs.</p>
<font color="#C0C0C0">

<img src="reactor2.jpg"><br><br>
-&nbsp;This is a good spot for any axis player to cover the box of explosives,
and you will often find people putting an MG42 up here, which can be very
effective.
<br><br>
-&nbsp;The main thing Axis should try and do, is co-operate. You have to go
outside the door in order to keep the box of explosives, so this gives the
Allies a chance to take a uniform. Obviously the Axis players should say
straight away if they loose their suit, and then their team-mates can react
accordingly.
<br><br>
-&nbsp;There are plenty of good mg spots around the map, the most useful being
above the small hole which looks down onto the flag, this is only for when the
gate has been destroyed. If you use this spot, then you should always have
cg_drawgun 0 on, otherwise you can't see the whole area.
<br><br>
-&nbsp;For the back, by the gun controls, you really need lots of engineers, and
once again good teamwork. Because you can shoot through the grills being on the
balcony is not always a good idea, and it is better to be on top of the towers.
You can also shoot through the steps above the actual controls, so you can catch
any covert ops or engineers trying to get the controls.
<br><br>
-&nbsp;The quickest way to the controls is through the Axis only doors, but you
can't open them silently, so people will know when you are coming.
<br><br>
-&nbsp;The best thing for Axis on this map, as mentioned before, is teamwork.
The map gets crazy at times as people try and satchel the controls, and try and
repair them. Reactor is also know as quite a lotto map, meaning that it is
lucky, so if you get a bit of luck, and work well as a team, then you should be
ok.</font>
