<h4><font color="#ffffff">Getting Started</font></h4>
<p>First, you need to go into the Game Dir/Enemy Territory/Docs folder and look
for a file called PlayerGuide.html. That will give you a quick introduction to
the new player classes and game mechanics.
<p>I think that you'll find most of what you know in RTCW ports over pretty well
to Enemy Territory. For sure, lots of people will drift towards the new weapons
and classes at first, but give it some time and everything will even out.

<h4><font color="#ffffff">What's Changed Since Test?</font></h4>
<font color="#C0C0C0">This is not an all inclusive list, but I thought I'd
highlight some of the game changes (but not bug fixes), many made in response to
community feedback, that Splash Damage/id/Activision made to the game since the
release of Test. All I can say is, &quot;WOW!!!&quot;. There should be no doubt
that the developers listened closely to what the community said they wanted from
the game and delivered in spades. Thanks!</font>

<p>With the exception of the Medic and Field Ops, everyone gets a bunch of
weapons to play around with. Medics and Field Ops just get the default SMG.
<p><b>NOTE: This was tested by launching two instances of the game, creating a
fireteam (so I could see a discrete health figure), then shooting the crap out
of myself.</b>
<p>A couple of observations:
<p>&nbsp;
<ol>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Headshot damage has been reduced by 20 points when
    the target has a helmet</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">MP40s and Thompsons do the same amount of damage</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Scoped weapons will do more damage (body and head)
    while in scoped mode</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Base pistol damage has been upped to 18</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Range affects damage. Pistols, SMGs, and the FG42
    deal half damage at long range. I don't know what consitutes &quot;long
    range&quot; but I tested shooting from the top of the MG42 hill to the
    Allied side of the bridging site on Fueldump</font></li>

<p><a name="weaponscript"></a>
<h4><font color="#ffffff">How Do I Write Weapon &amp; Class Binds?</font></h4>
<font color="#C0C0C0">For those of you who want to write class selection binds
and scripts, the team/class/weapon variables have been changed significantly.
Now, the three seperate variables from RTCW are combined into a single
&quot;team&quot; variable, which takes the form:</font>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font>
<ol>
  <font color="#C0C0C0">bind x &quot;team [team][playertype][weapon]&quot;</font>
</ol>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Where:</font>
<ol>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">[team] is r=axis, b=allies</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">[playertype] is 0=soldier, 1=medic, 2=engineer,
    3=field ops, 4=covert ops</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">[weapon] is 3-35 (see chart above)</font></li>
</ol>
<p>So a bind to spawn me as an Axis engineer with the K43 w/ grenade launcher
would look like this:
<p>&nbsp;
<ol>
  bind x &quot;team r 2 23&quot;
</ol>
<p><a href="hints.htm#index">Back To Index</a>
<p><a name="weaponbank"></a>
<h4><font color="#ffffff">Weaponbank Assignments</font></h4>
<p>For those of you who want to write scripts involving weaponbanks, here are
the assignments for weaponbanks 1-7 by class. You'll notice that there is an
additional weaponbank (7) and it's only used by the engineer.

<p><a name="spawnpoint"></a>
<h4><font color="#ffffff">Can Spawnpoint Scripts Be Used In ET?</font></h4>
<font color="#C0C0C0">Yes and no. For each map, there are spawnpoints associated
with spawnpoint0 - spawnpoint4. However, the assignment of spawnpoint numbers to
spawnpoints is inconsistant. In RTCW, spawnpoint1 would always spawn you at the
rearmost axis spawnpoint. Not so in ET. Here is a chart of maps and spawnpoint
assignments:</font>

<h4><font color="#ffffff">So What New Commands Will I Need?</font></h4>
<font color="#C0C0C0">Since people are going to want to know how much their
basic configs have to change, I thought I'd offer up the list of commands I had
to add to my RTCW config. The good news is that I was able to copy just about
all of my scripts and configs from RTCW to ET, all except for the class select
script.</font>

    <ul>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">When crawling, you can't shoot, change weapons,
        or reload</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">If you are crouched, you can double tap forward
        to enter the prone position (you can turn this option off thru the
        Options Menu)</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">MG42s in the alt fire mode (bipod down) can only
        be fired from the prone. While in the alt fire position, you will also
        have a limited arc of fire, so be careful about your facing before
        getting into the prone position</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">If you are prone, you can't set up your mortar</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Panzerfausts cannot be fired from the prone
        position</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">If you use a crouch toggle and were in the
        crouched position when going prone, you will be crouched when you leave
        the prone position</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">You can also jump while in the prone position to
        get up quickly</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">bind x &quot;+mapexpand&quot; //brings up an

    <p>Tips:
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">You can still move and shoot while your command

        enemy he can see will be marked on your map</font>

<h4><font color="#ffffff">Other Frequently Asked Questions</font></h4>
<ul>
  <li><b><font color="#ffffff">Why can't soldiers pick the Mauser rifle?</font></b><br>
    <font color="#C0C0C0">For the most part, sniper weapons have been moved over
    to the new class, Covert Ops. They get to choose from either the FG42 or a
    silenced, scoped sniper rifle.</font>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><b><font color="#ffffff">What! No venom?</font></b><br>
    <font color="#C0C0C0">Nope. The venom was retired for a mobile MG42. I think
    you'll get used to the MG42 real quickly and learn how to use it in the most
    effective way. A couple of notes on the mobile MG42:</font>
    <p><font color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;</font>
    <ul>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">150 rounds per belt</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">4+1 belts max loadout</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">~30-35 rounds a second</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">No spin up time</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">MG 42 does overheat</font>
      <li><font color="#C0C0C0">2 firing modes:</font>
        <ol>
          <li><font color="#C0C0C0">not on bipod: can move, very inaccurate</font>
          <li><font color="#C0C0C0">on bipod: must be in prone, can crawl*, much
            more accurate</font></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><b><font color="#ffffff">What happened to the Lieutenant? How am I going
    to get my ammo?</font></b><br>
    <font color="#C0C0C0">The Lieutenant has just been rebranded as the Field
    Ops Specialist. The Field Ops can do everything the LT could except pick
    from the 3 available SMGs. The reason for this is the promotion and ranks
    system associated with experience. It would get confusing to have someone
    named Lieutenant Sergeant Iffy.</font>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><b><font color="#ffffff">WTF? How do I select spawn points?</font></b><br>
    <font color="#C0C0C0">Call up the limbo menu and look for the American or
    German flags. Those represent the spawn points. use your cursor to click on
    any of your sides spawn points and that's where you'll respawn. There is a
    way to select spawn points through the use of a spawn point script, but
    there is currently no standard naming/numbering convention for spawn points.</font>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><b><font color="#ffffff">The game doesn't recognize MOUSE3. What's up with
    that?</font></b><br>
    <font color="#C0C0C0">This is a problem I had. ET would not recognize the
    same MOUSE3 bind that I use for RTCW. Uninstalling the Logitech Mouseware
    program fixed this for me. On another note, you can now bind MOUSE4 and
    MOUSE5.</font>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <li><b><font color="#ffffff">What happened to +dropweapon?</font></b><br>
    <font color="#C0C0C0">Currently, +dropweapon doesn't work. However, you can
    still exchange weapons. Any class, which has multiple weapon options, can
    exchange their current weapon for another - as long as the new weapon was
    originally available to them. The exception is that engineers and medics can
    pick up the other side's default SMG. To exchange weapons, stand over the
    new weapon until the tool tip appears, then hit +activate.</font></li>
