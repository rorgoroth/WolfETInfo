<h4><font color="#ffffff">What's A Mortar?</font></h4>
</a><font color="#C0C0C0">The mortar is a new indirect fire weapon available to
the soldier. This weapon can only be fired once it has been emplaced (weapalt).
The mortar gunner starts off with 12 rounds but has a maximum ammo load of 17
rounds. Each shot takes half of the charge bar. Once the mortar is set up, you
will see an elevation scale and a traverse scale. This indicates your firing
limits. Moving the elevation scale up will cause the mortar round to drop closer
to you but will enable you to shoot over obstacles. Moving the elevation scale
down, will send your shot in a flatter arc, but you might hit intervening
obstacles.</font>
<p>After you fire a round, you will see a set of red marks on your targetting
scales. This shows the settings of your previous shot. It looks like 55 degrees
gives you the maximum range on flat ground. At 55 degrees, a round will travel
about 5 grid squares. I hope you all boned up on your trigonometry.

<p>If a Field Ops calls for artillery fire and the point of impact is within
your firing arc, you will see an orange crosshair appear on your targetting
scales. This really only indicates the <u>direction</u> of the artillery strike
and not the settings you need to land a mortar round in the same spot. In fact,
using the orange crosshair as your settings for the next shot, could have
disasterous consequences - I blew myself up once.

</ol>
<p>Another tool available to the mortar gunner is the command map. Call up the
command map after an artillery strike by a field ops, or after a mortar shot and
you will see either a red, white, and blue bullseye (shows where the mortar
round hit) or an orange crosshair (where the artillery barrage landed).

<p><font color="#C0C0C0">Mortar Tips</font>
<p>&nbsp;
<ol>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Learn how to read the top graphical features shown
    on your command map - it will really help you figure out where you're
    shooting</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">After you've fired off a round, but before it lands,
    call up the command map. You will see a marker show up when the round hits
    and you can get right back to adjusting fire</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">When trying to determine range, learn how to bracket
    your shots. If the first round lands short, send the next one long, and
    successively halve the adjustment. If you try to walk the round up to the
    target, you could be trying forever.</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">You can make a range card pretty easily by finding
    some level ground and practice shooting. Take a piece of cardboard and
    measure from the center of your symbol to the center of the mortar marker
    and record the elevation setting you used.</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Remember, when shooting from a higher to lower
    elevation, your rounds will travel a little further. Likewise, when shooting
    from a lower to a higher elevation, your rounds will not travel quite as
    far.</font></li>
</ol>
<p>Anyone having problems nailing the elevation-to-range issue with your shiny
new mortar? One thing you can do is make yourself a simple little range card
template to do the conversion for you. Here's how you make one:
<p>&nbsp;
<ol>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Grab yourself a stiff piece of clear plastic (a
    4&quot; x 4&quot; piece works for my screen res). I took the cover off an
    old CD jacket</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">With a fine marker, draw a line at the 45 degree
    angle from the edges</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Start a local server and spawn with the mortar.</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Find a flat piece of terrain to shoot across, set
    your elevation at 45 degrees, and shoot</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Call up your command map and see where the shot
    land. Now, take your plastic template, hold it over your screen, and place
    the corner dead center over the icon that represents you. Use the 45 degree
    line to connect your icon with the icon representing the mortar hit. Make a
    mark and annotate it as 45 degrees</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">Continue in 5-10 degree increments up to about 80
    degrees</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">When you are done, what you should have is a range
    ruler that you can use to measure the distance, and therefore the required
    elevation, from your position to anywhere on the map. I tried this out and
    got 4 1-shot hits.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">A couple of things to remember:&nbsp;</font>
<ul>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">When shooting from higher to lower, your shots will
    travel further than on level ground</font>
  <li><font color="#C0C0C0">When shooting from lower to higher, your shots will
    travel not as far as on level ground</font></li>
</ul>
<p>If you are having problems keeping your command map out, here is a simple
script that you can use to pull your map out with one click and put it away with
a second click:
<p>&nbsp;
<ul>
  <font color="#C0C0C0">//Command map script<br>
  //keeps map out until put away. used mostly when spotting artillery/mortar
  fire</font><br>
  <p>set mapout &quot;+mapexpand; +mapexpand; set nextmap vstr mapin&quot;<br>
  set mapin &quot;-mapexpand; -mapexpand; set nextmap vstr mapout&quot;<br>
  set nextmap &quot;vstr mapout&quot;<br>
  bind x &quot;vstr nextmap&quot;<br>
  </p>
</ul>
