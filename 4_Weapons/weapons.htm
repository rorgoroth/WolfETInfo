<b class="subheading"><font color="#FFFFFF">Sidearms</font></b><br>
<br>
When your Panzer is reloading, your sniper position is revealed and you have to
encounter close combat, or your SMG is out of ammo, what do you do? You whip out
your trusty sidearm and humiliate your opponent with a weapon that is smaller
than his!<br>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Knife:</b> <font color="#C0C0C0">All players in Enemy Territory are
    equipped with one standard issue WW2 army knife. The Knife is mostly a last
    alternative for players running out of ammunition, but also the assassins'
    potential best friend. If you can successfully sneak up on an enemy player,
    you will find that a quick stab in the back can instantly kill an opponent
    without alerting his teamates of your presence.</font><br>
    <br>
  <li><b>Pistol:</b> <font color="#C0C0C0">The Allies have the Colt1911 as their
    spare gun and the Axis have the Luger. Pistols are typically only needed
    when you've got no other choice, but should not be underestimated because
    when they are used right they are extremely deadly to your foe. Pistols have
    slower rate of fire than the SMG's but this can be helped by pressing the
    fire button rapidly instead of holding it in. The $10,000 tip when you are
    armed with only a pistol to defend yourself is to keep cool and aim for the
    opponent's head before firing you weapon. With a little practice you will
    see those helmets popping off in no time, which greatly increases the
    weapon's usefulness and does wonders for your survival rate. The Covert Ops
    class can also fit the pistols with a silencer. Also, with a high enough
    Light Weapons skill you'll find that you get to wield two pistols akimbo
    style. It's double the rate of fire, double the deadliness and umpteen times
    the fun.</font></li>
</ul>
<b class="subheading"><font color="#FFFFFF">Submachine Guns (SMGs)</font></b><br>
<br>
<font color="#C0C0C0">The most commonly used weapons in Enemy Territory are the
SMGs. It's the only choice for Field Ops and Medics, and obviously you'll also
see many Engineers using these. Maybe even the occasional Soldier. Each SMG has
its own characteristics but in general there are a few tips you always should
keep in mind when using one of these babies. As often as possible you should
crouch or prone when firing. This greatly increases your accuracy and thus saves
ammo by taking down your opponent faster than it otherwise would. Also, you
should aim for the head. Headshots are wicked, and if you can land one or two of
those your opponent will be calling for a medic before he knew what hit him.<br>
<br>
Another useful thing to remember is to fire in bursts, make it a habit to fire
like 5 shots, stop, and fire another 5 round. Also if you can avoid it, don't go
anywhere without a full clip of ammo, after a fire fight reload so that your
clip is full. If you have to reload in the middle of a hand to hand fight it
might very well be the end of you. So the main thing to remember is: fire in
burst, duck, reload and repeat.<br>
</font><br>

<ul>
  <li><b>Sten:</b> <font color="#C0C0C0">The Sten is a silenced SMG available to
    the Covert Ops class, offering great accuracy and stealth. The weapon can
    overheat so you should be careful unless you want it to temporarily jam, but
    if you follow the tip of firing in burst this is a problem you will not
    notice! The Sten's great accuracy gives it an edge over most other weapons
    on medium to long distance range. Take your time and fire short rapid bursts
    to your enemy's head. Remember to crouch to increase the accuracy even
    further.</font><br>
    <br>
  <li><b>FG42:</b> <font color="#C0C0C0">The FG42 is a weapon available to the
    Covert Ops. It's a sort of mix between a rifle and an SMG. It's a powerful
    gun with a slightly smaller clip size and a slightly slower fire rate
    compared to SMG's. This is however more than outweighed by the fact that it
    comes equipped with a scope for taking care of those enemies that pester you
    from afar. As always the clue is to crouch before you fire, and this is
    actually more crucial because you will use this weapon at long distances,
    and stray bullets are bound to happen unless you crouch or prone.<br>
    </font><br>
  <li><b>MP40 &amp; Thompson:</b> <font color="#C0C0C0">The Axis Standard Issue
    SMG available to Field Ops, Medics, Engineers and Soldiers is the MP40 and
    its Allied counterpart is the Thompson. These two weapons behave nearly
    identical when used. The MP40 is slightly more accurate than the Thompson
    but the Thompson compensates by delivering slightly more damage per bullet.
    Again; crouching, bursting and headshots are the key to success.</font></li>
</ul>
<b class="subheading">Rifles</b><br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><b>K43 &amp; M1 Garand:</b> <font color="#C0C0C0">Rifles pretty much
    behave the same regardless of whether you pick up the Axis K43 or the Allied
    M1 Garand. Rifles are available to each side's Covert Ops and Engineer
    class. The Covert Ops use these rifles as a sniper rifle with a powerful
    scope and a silencer. As a sniper weapon both rifles deliver a high damage
    output per round and gives the Covert Ops the ability to take out enemy
    players from far away. When you snipe you should try to stay behind as much
    cover as possible to minimize chance of detection by enemy snipers or others
    with long range weaponry. Going prone might be a good idea in order to get
    the best possible aim and smallest possible silhouette. Beware of the rather
    heavy recoil as it tends to mess up your aim after each shot. Due to the
    long distance, moving personnel will not be at the same spot when the bullet
    hits. Therefore, try to predict where they will be at the time of impact...
    usually just a little to the side of their head.<br>
    <br>
    If equipped by an Engineer the rifles are no longer sniper rifles just
    ordinary rifles but with a rather interesting alternate fire. The Engineer
    can attach a grenade, &quot;a rifle grenade&quot;, on the muzzle of the gun
    and lob it over a great distance for some hefty impact damage. This requires
    some practice though but with a good aim this is a nasty instant kill
    feature that should be looked out for. Tip: the rifle grenades need to
    travel some distance to blow up on impact, so it's not the best choice in
    close combat since they can be easily dodged before they detonate. Think of
    this as a mortar-light!</font></li>
